# 🗺️ Country Info Dashboard
This is a solution to the ['REST Countries API with color theme switcher' challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).
The result is a country info dashboard that allows uses to view, filter and search for countries as well as view additional information about each country on its own detail page.

## 🎯 The Challenge
Users should be able to:
- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- **Search** for a country using an input field
- **Filter** countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the **border countries** on the detail page
- View the **optimal layout** for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus:** Toggle the **colour scheme** between light and dark mode

Additional Features Added:
- Persistence of colour scheme upon reload using **local storage**
- Ability to **multi-select** when filtering by region
- **Transitions** for a smoother user experience
- **Loading** icon/text whilst content renders
